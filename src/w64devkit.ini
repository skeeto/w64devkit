; home: Sets the HOME environment variable for the shell. Place a
; .profile in this directory to do further environment configuration
; using the shell itself.

; This path may be relative and reference environment variables using
; percent symbols, like a batch script. Variables will be expanded, a

; an absolute path relative to this .ini file.

; may also contain environment variables.

; paths, so be mindful when using non-ASCII paths for this value.
